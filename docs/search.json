I used Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn to analyze the data and answer questions about the comedians’ YouTube stats. The dataset included features like subscribers, views, and total videos, and the I used this data to compare the performance of different comedians on YouTube.\nThe analysis reveals that Zakir Khan has the highest subscribers, followed by Abhishek Upmanyu and Anubhav Singh Bassi. Samay Raina has the highest number of videos, but Anubhav Bassi’s quality over quantity approach has led to a high turnover rate. The analysis also highlights the underrepresentation of female comedians in the Indian comedy space, with none of the top comedians being female. This suggests that there is still a long way to go in terms of promoting diversity and inclusion in the Indian comedy industry.\nCheck out the second part of this article to dive deeper into the analysis and explore more interesting insights about these comedians here."
