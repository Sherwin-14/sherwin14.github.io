## ShopEase E-commerce Platform Analysis

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
In the ShopEase project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of our e-commerce store to uncover customer behavior patterns and preferences. Tasked with providing actionable insights for our stakeholders, I applied RFM analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing habits. This led to the development of a machine learning model that identifies distinct customer segments, enabling personalized marketing strategies. From data collection to model evaluation, each step was meticulously executed to enhance customer retention, optimize our online store, and drive business growth.

I embarked on a project to leverage the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) dataset to predict taxi fares and provide insights into the operations and business of the TLC. The solution includes an automated machine learning (AutoML) model for fare prediction, an infographic for data visualization, and SQL queries for data analysis.

I developed an AutoML model that predicts taxi fares based on various factors such as pickup and dropoff locations, trip distance, and time of day. This model helps the TLC in fare regulation and prevents overcharging by taxi drivers. Additionally, I created a visually appealing infographic that represents key insights and trends from the dataset, aiding the TLC in understanding patterns and trends to inform their decision-making process. I also used SQL queries to answer various business questions, such as identifying the most popular pickup and dropoff locations and calculating the average fare per trip. The final outcome is a comprehensive solution that enhances the TLC’s ability to regulate fares and gain valuable insights from their data.

## Atliq Mart Supply Chain Optimization - Journey to Supply Chain Excellence

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
AtliQ Mart, an FMCG manufacturer in Gujarat, faced customer retention issues due to delivery problems. To address this, the supply chain team tracked daily ‘On-time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery metrics using Power BI. This project aimed to identify inefficiencies and improve service levels through data visualization and analytics, ultimately optimizing supply chain operations.

I tracked a multitude of terminologies, including On-time and In Full delivery metrics, which we monitored on a monthly basis. Additionally, I analyzed product-level insights, such as delivery performance, inventory levels, and lead time, alongside customer-based insights, including delivery performance, order fulfillment rates, and lead time. These metrics were tracked and analyzed on a monthly basis, providing us with a comprehensive view of the supply chain's performance and enabling us to identify areas of inefficiency and optimize our operations to improve service levels and customer satisfaction.

## Attrition Prediction and Prevention: An HR Pilot Program Leveraging AutoML and Data Analytics 

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
The HR Pilot Program aims to improve employee retention by analyzing a dataset of 15,000 data points, conducting a pilot program for new employees, and using machine learning to predict attrition. An AutoML model using PyCaret’s Decision Tree algorithm achieves over 95% accuracy in predicting attrition. The project utilizes Google BigQuery, Python, PyCaret, Google Sheets, and Looker Studio for data analysis, predictive modeling, and reporting.

## English Premier League Analysis - An Analysis of EPL Season 20/21 

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
In the heart of football fandom, I embarked on a journey to unravel the mysteries of the English Premier League’s 2020/21 season. Armed with NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for visualization, I crafted an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash.

I gathered EPL 2020/21 season data, used NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning and transformation, created visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, developed an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash, and conducted EDA to uncover trends and patterns. The final outcome is a comprehensive analysis that provides deeper insights into the EPL and demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in sports analytics.
