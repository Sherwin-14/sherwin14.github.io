    "text": "Metropolitan Motion - The Analytic Route of NY’s Yellow Cabs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI embarked on a project to leverage the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) dataset to predict taxi fares and provide insights into the operations and business of the TLC. The solution includes an automated machine learning (AutoML) model for fare prediction, an infographic for data visualization, and SQL queries for data analysis.\nI developed an AutoML model that predicts taxi fares based on various factors such as pickup and dropoff locations, trip distance, and time of day. This model helps the TLC in fare regulation and prevents overcharging by taxi drivers. Additionally, I created a visually appealing infographic that represents key insights and trends from the dataset, aiding the TLC in understanding patterns and trends to inform their decision-making process. I also used SQL queries to answer various business questions, such as identifying the most popular pickup and dropoff locations and calculating the average fare per trip. The final outcome is a comprehensive solution that enhances the TLC’s ability to regulate fares and gain valuable insights from their data.\n\n\n\nClick on the image to be redirected to project’s repo/hosting"

    "text": "Atliq Mart Supply Chain Optimization - Journey to Supply Chain Excellence\n\n\nAtliQ Mart, an FMCG manufacturer in Gujarat, faced customer retention issues due to delivery problems. To address this, the supply chain team tracked daily ‘On-time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery metrics using Power BI. This project aimed to identify inefficiencies and improve service levels through data visualization and analytics, ultimately optimizing supply chain operations.\nI tracked a multitude of terminologies, including On-time and In Full delivery metrics, which we monitored on a monthly basis. Additionally, I analyzed product-level insights, such as delivery performance, inventory levels, and lead time, alongside customer-based insights, including delivery performance, order fulfillment rates, and lead time. These metrics were tracked and analyzed on a monthly basis, providing us with a comprehensive view of the supply chain’s performance and enabling us to identify areas of inefficiency and optimize our operations to improve service levels and customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\n Click on the image to be redirected to project’s repo/hosting"

My analysis revealed key trends and led to 11 strategic recommendations to boost active users and revenue. This project is a foundation for future improvements and data-driven decisions.\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the impact of the 5G launch, I tracked and analyzed several key metrics, including Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), Monthly Active Users (MAU), and change in revenue. By comparing these metrics pre- and post-5G launch, I was able to identify areas of opportunity and develop targeted strategies to address the decline in user engagement and revenue.\n\n\n\nClick on the image to be redirected to project’s repo/hosting"
